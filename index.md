# Hot Shot Hoops
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project - Useless Machine
My starter project was the useless machine. The Useless machine is a machine where you flick the one visible switch on it and the machine mechanically moves to flip the switch back and then hides itself back so the flip once again is the only thing visible outside of the box. The two resistors and the screw temrinal were used to keep the pcb working. There was no coding involved but instead we made use of the mechanics of the motor and arm to completete the machine. Overall the machine revolves around the electric motor. The electric motor operates by having magnets inside and when an electric currenent is released along with a magnetic field, this magnetic field repels the magnet causing it to rotate in a ceratain direction. When the magnetic field is reversed it results in the magnets to repel in the opposite direction, making the motor move in the oppoosite direction. The visible switch causes the motor to rotate in different dirrections. When the switch is triggered the motor spins towards the switch until the arm reaches the switch and pushes it back causing the motor to rotate the opposite way. The motor is the stopped when the bottom of the arm presses on the click switch turning the machine off. One moment where I felt extremely discouraged during the project was when I had to put the box together as many parts did not fix together because of manufacturing issues. During these trying times, I was able to keep my composure and find a solution to my problems such as adding extra washers to tilt the machine the switch would be flicked by the arm. The parts I really enjoyed learning how to solder different components onto the pcb to get the machine to operate. This was also a great project to learn how to make use of many different switches to manipulate motor movement.
