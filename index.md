# Hot Shot Hoops
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the sensor and LED to the Arduino to ensurethat circut and sensor were performing well. I wrote a code that checked if there was motion within the sensors range and if so it would blink red. At first glance this test seems very rudimentary but I ran into many errors. One of these errors was that usually sensors come with three wires, one red, one black, one white and this was the case for the sensors that I recieved. The problem was that instead of the black wire being ground which is usually the case, the white wire was ground so it tooksome time to figure this our and adjust. Another issue I encountered duringthis first milestone wasone of the sensors did not work. I was able to deduct this by replacing the working sensor with the sensor that was not working onto the circuit that I knew was working. I plan to fix this issue by buying another sensor that will work. One potential problem that I have found while testing my working sensor is that the sensor does not detect fast movements or objects that well. I will further test the consistency of the PIR sensor when I get my second sensor. If the sensor continues to be inconsistent, I will instead use an ultra-sonic sensor. Although it picks up the movement of the object better, it does not constantly check it's range for movement.

# Starter Project - Useless Machine
My starter project was the useless machine. The Useless machine is a machine where you flick the one visible switch on it and the machine mechanically moves to flip the switch back and then hides itself back so the flip once again is the only thing visible outside of the box. The two resistors and the screw temrinal were used to keep the pcb working. There was no coding involved but instead we made use of the mechanics of the motor and arm to completete the machine. Overall the machine revolves around the electric motor. The electric motor operates by having magnets inside and when an electric currenent is released along with a magnetic field, this magnetic field repels the magnet causing it to rotate in a ceratain direction. When the magnetic field is reversed it results in the magnets to repel in the opposite direction, making the motor move in the oppoosite direction. The visible switch causes the motor to rotate in different dirrections. When the switch is triggered the motor spins towards the switch until the arm reaches the switch and pushes it back causing the motor to rotate the opposite way. The motor is the stopped when the bottom of the arm presses on the click switch turning the machine off. One moment where I felt extremely discouraged during the project was when I had to put the box together as many parts did not fix together because of manufacturing issues. During these trying times, I was able to keep my composure and find a solution to my problems such as adding extra washers to tilt the machine the switch would be flicked by the arm. The parts I really enjoyed learning how to solder different components onto the pcb to get the machine to operate. This was also a great project to learn how to make use of many different switches to manipulate motor movement.
